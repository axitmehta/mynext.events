				<h1>About MyNext.Events</h1>
				<hr class="small">
				<p class="lead">In 2008, I, Tobias Sattler, joined <a href="//www.united-domains.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">united-domains AG</a> and started to represent and to participate at domain, hosting and internet conferences around the world. Keeping track of all events was quite troublesome and after many tries I stuck with <a href="//www.google.com/calendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Calendar</a> in 2010.</p>
				<p class="lead">I thought about sharing my calendar to the community to help others and make their lifes easier, too. So, I wrapped up a website to display the events and make it more enjoyable to read than just an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ics file</a>.</p>
				<p class="lead">After many attempts, I published it under my own website at <a href="//tobiassattler.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tobiassattler.com</a>. Later on I realised that I want to spin it off to an own project and therefore the idea was born to do MyNext.Events.</p>
				<p class="lead">This is a free and open project and if you want to add your meetup, event or conference to this calendar, please do not hesitate and drop a note.</p>
